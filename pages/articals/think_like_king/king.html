        <h1>The arts of thinking like <em style="color: rgb(255, 183, 0);">A King</em></h1>

        <h2>You are the king of your world!</h2>
        <p>As a king, the weight of your decisions is immense, as they have the power to shape the fate of your kingdom and its people. Each choice you make must be carefully considered, recognizing the far-reaching consequences they may bring. You realize that your responsibility goes far beyond your desires; It encompasses the welfare and prosperity of all those under your rule.

          In the field of governance, there is no room for complacency or self-indulgence. You hold yourself to the highest standards, knowing that the ambitions you set for yourself will be reflected in the achievements of the entire kingdom. If you seek greatness, you must strive for it with determination and unwavering diligence. On the other hand, if you settle for mediocrity, your majesty will fade into the shadows.
          
          Being a king requires self-confidence and self-assurance. In every room I enter, you carry yourself knowing that you are the sovereign, entrusted with the welfare of your kingdom. Although humility is a virtue, you must always remember that your duties require respect and authority. This is not arrogance but recognition of your role as a leader and protector of your people.</p>

        <h1>The way of the <em style="color: rgb(0, 190, 212);">Vikings</em></h1>

        <h2>Why should you start every day with a cold shower?</h2>
        <p>If we look back in history to the 8th-11th century the Vikings were famous for their military strength and their mental control made them fearsome and formidable opponents, the Vikings were known as those who would fight to the last drop of their blood, and in the middle of a battle when they had to get out of their ships into the icy waters of the ocean to fight Do you think the frozen water and cold weather of the area will stop them? At least that's what their enemies thought!
          But no, they jumped into the water and wanted to fight! and that's what we need to learn from them, you can't let the circumstances stop you, you have to jump into the water no matter what and that's exactly the mentality of taking a cold bath every morning right after getting out of bed!
          If the Vikings can jump into the cold ocean, we can take a cold shower every day too!!!
          Not only will you develop mental resilience, but the cold shower will help you deal with depression and overthinking because when you enter a cold shower, the sudden transition to cold puts your body in survival mode and you will forget everything and concentrate on the here and now!
          (There are many more benefits to a cold shower, but we won't list them here)
          So what are you waiting for take on a challenge!
          In the next two months or even just for the next month, take a cold shower every morning and see how your days and mental health improve!</p>

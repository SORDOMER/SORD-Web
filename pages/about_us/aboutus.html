        <h1>About <em style="color: rgb(255, 98, 0);">SORD</em></h1>

        <h2>Who we are?</h2>
        <p>The SORD group was established with the help the cooperation of its two founders, Omer Sarusi and Dan Rolland, who decided that after being able to improve their lives so significantly with the help of a few simple principles, they take it upon themselves as a goal to help more men who are in the same situation they once were. After thinking, they concluded that their first side to spread the knowledge they gained should be a website because of its accessibility and the ability to transfer a lot of knowledge in one place and that's how they founded SORD</p>

        <h2>Why are we here?</h2>
        <p>We are here to make a difference!
          We see the crisis that men in the world are going through, that they feel they are lost without a purpose and their wife or girlfriend if they even have one! They were treated with disdain and without respect and society pushes them messages that being masculine is toxic!
          And we have one message. We see you!
          And we are here to help!
          You see, we used to be in the same situation as most men today, we would let people treat us with disdain, and we would lie on the bed and scroll through Instagram until the wee hours of the night whenever we had free time.
          And what's more, both Dan and I were diagnosed with depression! We know what you're going through!
          And that's why we opened the site so you don't have to keep going through it. Make no mistake, the path we offer is not easy! But if you try to do it you will find that not only will it improve your life by 180 degrees, but it will also make you feel good about yourself!
          Imagine for a moment yourself with a muscular body walking into the office of your business and everyone is looking at you and standing up to show you respect. Imagine that at the end of work your beautiful wife is waiting for you at home! And your dream car is in the parking lot outside!
          It was fun to imagine, wasn't it? All that power and status made you feel good!
          I know this because you are a man and we as men are born with the desire to conquer and establish our empire! And that's why we're here to give you all the tools you'll need to successfully create an empire. Will you do something with the tools we give, we will leave the decision in your hands.</p>

        <h2>What do we believe?</h2>
        <p>First! We believe in hard work, without hard work, no matter what knowledge we give you, you won't be able to do anything with it. We don't believe in laziness and even despise it, so if you're a lazy kid who can't get himself out of bed to do something with life, this site is not for you!
          Secondly, we believe in self-discipline, a person without strong self-discipline cannot reach his potential in life!
          That's why we teach here how to produce iron discipline from zero to a hundred!
          Third thing, we believe that no matter what happens to you, it is your sole fault, whether it is a great success or a serious failure! So if you are someone who does not take responsibility for their actions and their consequences, you are welcome to exit the site and go back to seeing P*** or scrolling through Instagram for hours, you have no place here!
          These are the three principles by which we act and by which we will act!
          If you connect to all three and agree with us then we hope to see you using the site's content to improve your life!
          We are here for any questions or advice you may want, you are welcome to contact us
